Articulate use cases for complex sharing such as territory management or account
teams should be used.


Full Sharing Model Usage Users/Licenses
Most Standard Salesforce license types take full advantage of the sharing model components. The license might not make a module
accessible, or even some objects accessible. For example, the Force.com Free edition can't access any CRM objects. However, the
sharing entities, and functionality, still exists and is ready when and if the module ever does become active.


High Volume Customer Portal License
High Volume Customer Portal (HVPU) license users (including Community and Service Cloud license users) do not utilize the sharing
model. HVPU licenses have their own sharing model that works by foreign key match between the portal user (holding the license)
and the data on Account and Contact lookups. HVPU license is only used for the Customer Portal and not the Partner Portal.


Chatter Free License
The Chatter Free license doesn't follow the standard sharing model. Chatter Free is a collaboration-only license with the following
features: Chatter, Profile, People, Groups, Files, Chatter Desktop, and limited Salesforce1 app access. The license doesn't have access
to CRM records (standard or custom objects) and Content functionality, and therefore, there is no sharing.
